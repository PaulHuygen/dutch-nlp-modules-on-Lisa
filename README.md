NLPP
====

Install the latest Dutch [Newsreader]{http://www.newsreader-project.eu} pipeline on a decent Linux computer.

The installer obtains the modules directly from repo's like Github or,
if still necessary, from a closed snapshot archive. To get modules
from the snapshot it is necessary to obtain an SSH key (Contact me). 

Currently the installer installs only on Ubuntu or Centos Linux.

## Installation

Installation goes as follows:

1. cd to the top-dirctory where you want the pipeline to be.
2. Put the private key "nrkey" in this directory
3. Put the script from the next section in it.
4. Execute the script.

When all went well, you end up with a directory-tree beginning with
`nlpp`. Directory `nlpp/test` contains a bunch of NAF files that have
been produced by the pipeline. These NAFs have been generated by the
script `nlpp/bin/test`. That script shows how the pipeline can be
used. Furthermore, there is a PDF file `nlpp/nuweb/nlpp.pdf` that
gives more explanation about the pipeline and how it is constructed. 


## Installation script

The following script installs the pipeline in Ubuntu Linux (tested on
Ubuntu 14.04:

```
#!/bin/bash
SOCKET=`pwd`
PROJROOT=$SOCKET/nlpp
sudo apt-get -y install git mercurial g++ make m4 python-pip python-virtualenv
sudo apt-get -y install libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev python-dev zlib1g-dev unzip
sudo apt-get -y install libboost-all-dev libbz2-dev pkg-config libgfortran3
scp -i nrkey newsreader@kyoto.let.vu.nl:nlpp_resources/* .
git clone https://github.com/PaulHuygen/nlpp.git
cd nlpp
cd $PROJROOT/nuweb
make sources
../bin/install-modules
cd $PROJROOT
bin/test
```
